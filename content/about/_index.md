Funded by the [Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/188976), and hosted at the [Centre for International and Environmental Studies (CIES)](https://www.graduateinstitute.ch/cies), the [PANARCHIC: Power and Networks and the Rate of Change in Institutional Complexes](https://panarchic.ch/) project began in September 2020.
Its aim: to contribute three pillars -- theory, method, and empirics -- to the comparative analysis of institutional (aka regime or governance) complexity.
The Global Governance Observatory is the repository for the empirical collections of the project.

The Global Governance Observatory collects and extends existing datasets on global governance in various domains,
arraying them in ensembles that enable users to employ sophisticated, nuanced, robust, and replicable analyses.

Tools to download and work with the data are available in R via [manydata](https://manydata.ch/). 
This package is in turn supported by [manypkgs](https://globalgov.github.io/manypkgs/), for creating and extending manydata packages, 
and [messydates](https://globalgov.github.io/messydates/), for working with a more flexible class of dates in R.
Currently there are 5 data packages available through the [manydata](https://manydata.ch/) package:

- [manystates](https://globalgov.github.io/manystates/)
- [manyenviron](https://globalgov.github.io/manyenviron/)
- [manytrade](https://globalgov.github.io/manytrade/)
- [manyhealth](https://globalgov.github.io/manyhealth/)
- [manyigos](https://globalgov.github.io/manyigos/)

Also supported by the project is development on 3 network methodological packages:

- [manynet](https://stocnet.github.io/manynet/)
- [migraph](https://stocnet.github.io/migraph/)
- [goldfish](https://stocnet.github.io/goldfish/)

While this website is a work-in-progress, 
these projects are nearing maturity, and are intended to be useful beyond the project,
so please check them out and let us know how they meet or diverge from your expectations.
