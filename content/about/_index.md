Led by [Dr. James Hollway](https://jameshollway.com/), hosted at the [Centre for International and Environmental Studies (CIES)](https://www.graduateinstitute.ch/cies), and funded by the [Swiss National Science Foundation (SNSF)](https://data.snf.ch/grants/grant/188976), the 'PANARCHIC: Power and Networks and the Rate of Change in Institutional Complexes' project began in Semptember 2020.

Institutional complexes change through statesâ€™ interdependent decisions to join, reform, or create international institutions. Rendering these decisions in the form of a network enables the leveraging of network theory and network methods. Network and power analysis can both help us understand how the rate of change in these dependent variables may differ across the institutional complex, rendered as a network. Network analysis makes more precise institutionalist suggestions that denser, overlapping institutional complexes might slow down institutional changes. Power analysis reminds both institutional and network analysis that powerful actors can act or force others to act where others cannot. Combining these literatures promises to provide a more nuanced theory of the rate of institutional change. The project plans to study the effects of network and power on how quickly states join, reform, or create international institutions by examining the historical dynamics of three institutional networks from different trade, environment, and health. Alongside theoretical contributions, the project collected lots of data on global governance and developed methods to facilitate that users download, connect, and correct this data as they choose. All of the data and methods are publicly available in the form of R packages.

Currently there are 4 data packages:

- [manyenviron](https://github.com/globalgov/manyenviron)
- [manytrade](https://github.com/globalgov/manytrade)
- [manyhealth](https://globalgov.github.io/manyhealth/)
- [manystates](https://github.com/globalgov/manystates)

The methodological packages include:

- [manydata](https://manydata.ch/)
- [messydates](https://globalgov.github.io/messydates/)
- [manypkgs](https://globalgov.github.io/manypkgs/)
- [manynet](https://stocnet.github.io/manynet/)
- [migraph](https://stocnet.github.io/migraph/)

Please make sure to check them out and let us know how we can help further!
