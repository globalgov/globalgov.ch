## Manyenviron Data

`{manyenviron}` stores several datasets on various aspects of environmental treaties in different databases.
For example, the **Agreements** database is made of multiple datasets of environmental treaty titles with
specific information such as the agreement type (e.g. agreements, protocols, amendments, declarations), if
they are bilateral or multilateral, and some important dates such as the signature or entry into force.
The **Memberships** database contains lists of countries with the treaties to which they are parties to. It
also includes information on the signature date of the treaty or the withdrawal date of a party.
The **References** database is composed of a dataset that indicates the relationship (e.g. amended by,
cites, superseded by) between two treaties.

For a quick overview of the database and dataset in `{manyenviron}`, we can use the `compare_dimensions()` function from `{manydata}`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
#remotes::install_github("globalgov/manyenviron")
library(manydata)
library(manyenviron)
manydata::compare_dimensions(manyenviron::agreements)
manydata::compare_dimensions(manyenviron::memberships)
manydata::compare_dimensions(manyenviron::references)
```

To view the bibliographic references for a dataset, a database, or the whole package, we can also use `call_sources()` from `{manydata}`.

```{r, eval = FALSE}
manydata::call_sources("manyenviron", "agreements")
manydata::call_sources("manyenviron", "memberships")
manydata::call_sources("manyenviron", "references")
```
